			<h1>DBSCAN Interactive Example</h1>
			<p style="width: 60%;"> DBSCAN is a <i>density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm</i>: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors),
				 marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away).
				 DBSCAN is one of the most common clustering algorithms and also most cited in scientific literature.
